# Research Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used for analyzing the Málaga reservoirs weather data. The analysis follows a systematic approach to understand the relationships between meteorological variables and water reservoir levels.

## Data Sources

### Reservoir Data
- **Source**: Spanish water management authorities
- **Coverage**: 7 major reservoirs in Málaga province
- **Variables**: Water levels (absolute and percentage), reservoir codes and names
- **Temporal Coverage**: 2000-2024 (varies by reservoir)
- **Frequency**: Daily observations

### Meteorological Data
- **Source**: AEMET (Spanish Meteorological Agency)
- **Variables**: Temperature (min, max, mean), humidity (min, max, mean), wind speed and direction, solar radiation, precipitation
- **Quality Control**: Data averaged from 2-3 meteorological stations per reservoir area
- **Temporal Coverage**: Aligned with reservoir data
- **Frequency**: Daily observations

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading and Integration
- Load individual reservoir CSV files
- Combine into unified dataset
- Standardize date formats and column names
- Validate data integrity

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Precision Handling**: Round floating-point values to appropriate precision
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Use interpolation for short gaps, forward-fill for longer periods
- **Outlier Detection**: Flag values outside reasonable ranges
- **Duplicate Removal**: Remove duplicate records based on date and reservoir

### 3. Data Validation
- **Range Validation**: Check variables within expected physical ranges
- **Consistency Checks**: Verify min ≤ mean ≤ max relationships
- **Temporal Consistency**: Identify gaps and irregular patterns
- **Quality Metrics**: Calculate completeness and reliability scores

### 4. Feature Engineering
- **Temporal Features**: Extract year, month, day of year, season
- **Derived Metrics**: Calculate temperature ranges, humidity ranges, heat stress indices
- **Change Indicators**: Compute daily and weekly changes in reservoir levels
- **Aggregations**: Create monthly and seasonal averages

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Central tendencies, distributions, variability
- **Temporal Patterns**: Trend analysis, seasonal decomposition
- **Spatial Variations**: Compare patterns across reservoirs
- **Quality Assessment**: Data completeness and reliability evaluation

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- **Pearson Correlation**: Linear relationships between continuous variables
- **Spearman Correlation**: Monotonic relationships and rank correlations
- **Time-Lagged Correlations**: Account for delayed effects
- **Partial Correlations**: Control for confounding variables

### 3. Time Series Analysis
- **Trend Analysis**: Long-term patterns and climate signals
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Separate seasonal from trend components
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Identify temporal dependencies
- **Stationarity Testing**: Assess time series properties

### 4. Statistical Modeling
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Quantify variable relationships
- **Time Series Models**: ARIMA, seasonal models
- **Machine Learning**: Random forests, gradient boosting for non-linear patterns
- **Cross-Validation**: Assess model performance and generalizability

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Data Limitations
- **Weather Station Coverage**: Limited to 2-3 stations per reservoir
- **Missing Data**: Some gaps in historical records
- **Measurement Precision**: Inherent measurement uncertainties
- **Spatial Resolution**: Point measurements representing broader areas

### 2. Methodological Limitations
- **Causality**: Correlation does not imply causation
- **Non-linear Relationships**: May require advanced modeling
- **External Factors**: Human management, upstream effects not captured
- **Climate Variability**: Natural climate cycles may confound trends

### 3. Scope Limitations
- **Geographic Scope**: Limited to Málaga province
- **Temporal Scope**: Analysis period constrained by data availability
- **Variable Selection**: Limited to available meteorological parameters
